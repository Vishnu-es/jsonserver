      "title":"Preponderance of Advanced Data Structures",
      "description":"Data Structures are nothing but, a way in which data are stored such that efficiency for search, delete and retrieval makes a huge bounce. For example, Phone Directory can be efficiently implemented using Trie Data Structure. Yet, have you heard of it? Presumably not. Decidedly, least not intentionally, university curriculum does not necessitate such advanced data structure concepts. So, do you think linear or binary search is way more effective for searching of data stored on Google Server or retrieving data from a humongous database? Are companies like Google employ simple algorithms like Linear or Binary that we all studied in our academics? If not, did we learn the wrong concepts? No, not at all. Binary search approach was used to test potential COVID-19 patients in India so as to effectively increase the number of patients tested per day. Interesting, right? PageRank or simply PR is the algorithm used by google for searching webpages/links. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. Fibonacci heaps are used in some of the fastest known algorithms (asymptotically) for a lot of graph-related problems, such as the Shortest Path problem. Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure which is used to search an element within a large set of elements. Interval tree is mainly a geometric data structure and often used for windowing queries. Does digging into these topics have any immediate effects on academic level at least? Yes, it is. These advanced topics or untold topics in general, will muster you with further studies with topics like Data Mining, Neural Networks and Machine Learning Techniques. As we all have been taught that “no algorithm is one-size-fits-all”, i.e., there is no cut-and-dried solution to any of a particular problem - multiple solutions for a single problem exist. One does relatively well than the other in some situation. To add more, on a psychological note, learning these topic will enhance the way you think and change the neural circuitry which in turn produce staggeringly specialised mental representation. Overall, make you wise and expand your knowledge to a greater extend. Who knows you might come up with your own optimised data structures. Reminder: don’t miss my personal advise on my next article that might help you. I hope the information below will serve as a small appetiser to your main course. This is specially designed for VTU students/colleges or any state university where we need to stick to the guns of very limited electives to choose from. I mean, less chance to pick up a subject you like and get specialised.",

      "description":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.",
